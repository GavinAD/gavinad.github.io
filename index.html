    <h2>What's in the Box?</h2>
    <h4>Our team believes that this system is characterized by funnel feeding into a long,<br>
      looping tube that releases into a bucket with another tube for releasing the water stored in the bucket.<br>
    <p>The black box is a closed box that has a funnel on the top and a tube coming out of the side.</h4>
    <h5>Evidence</h5>
      When water was put into the funnel, the box would release water(excluding the first trial, in which no water came out).  <br>
      The amount of water wasnâ€™t the same amount as the water that was put in, which means <br>
      that there was a system more complex than just a tube from the funnel to the exit.  We were <br>
      tasked with trying to solve the mystery of the black box and find out what the system inside the box was.</p>
  <h5>Reasoning I</h5>
    <p>What we first did was do a series of tests with the box so we had data to use in creating a hypothesis.<br>
      We found that the black box released various percentages of the water that was put in, with it being more in some tests<br>
      and less in the others.  The most common output was less water coming out than in the input, and the first <br>
      trial resulted in no water coming out.</p>
  <h5>Reasoning II</h5>
    <p>The first trials were replicated in our model, with no water coming out of the model in the first few tests.<br>
      The pattern of less water coming out of the box was also replicated by our model.  This shows that our model had <br>
      similar results to the black box.</p>

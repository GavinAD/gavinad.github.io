    <h1>What's the the Box?</h1>
    <h4>Our team believes that this system is characterized by funnel feeding into a long, 
      looping tube that releases into a bucket with another tube for releasing the water stored in the bucket.
    <p>The black box is a closed box that has a funnel on the top and a tube coming out of the side.</h4>
      When water was put into the funnel, the box would release water(excluding the first trial, in which no water came out).  
      The amount of water wasnâ€™t the same amount as the water that was put in, which means 
      that there was a system more complex than just a tube from the funnel to the exit.  We were 
      tasked with trying to solve the mystery of the black box and find out what the system inside the box was.  </p>

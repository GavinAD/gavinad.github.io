    <h1>What's the the Box?</h1>
    <h4>Our team believes that this system is characterized by funnel feeding into a long, 
      looping tube that releases into a bucket with another tube for releasing the water stored in the bucket.
    <p>The black box is a closed box that has a funnel on the top and a tube coming out of the side.</h4>
    <h6>Evidence</h6>
      When water was put into the funnel, the box would release water(excluding the first trial, in which no water came out).  
      The amount of water wasnâ€™t the same amount as the water that was put in, which means 
      that there was a system more complex than just a tube from the funnel to the exit.  We were 
      tasked with trying to solve the mystery of the black box and find out what the system inside the box was.</p>
  <h6>Reasoning I</h6>
    <p>What we first did was do a series of tests with the box so we had data to use in creating a hypothesis.  
      We found that the black box released various percentages of the water that was put in, with it being more in some tests 
      and less in the others.  The most common output was less water coming out than in the input, and the first 
      trial resulted in no water coming out.</p>
  <h6>Reasoning II</h6>
    <p>The first trials were replicated in our model, with no water coming out of the model in the first few tests.  
      The pattern of less water coming out of the box was also replicated by our model.  This shows that our model had 
      similar results to the black box.</p>
